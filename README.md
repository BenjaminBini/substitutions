# Substitutions

This is a Twitter bot implementing XKCD subtitutions comics ([this one](http://xkcd.com/1288/), [this one](https://xkcd.com/1625/) and [this one](https://xkcd.com/1679/)).

I used [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) library.

# Installation

Add a `.env` file at the root of the project based on `.env.sample` and add your Twitter API credentials to it.

Then just run `npm install` or `yarn install` and `node app`.
